Based on the debug logs, we have several issues to fix:

Import error with server/s3 in Home.tsx
Need to ensure proper CSP headers to allow our S3 bucket domain
Fix the "location" and "user_id" database column errors
Fix authentication issues
Let's start by fixing the import error in Home.tsx and ensure proper access to our cloud storage.

// Helper functions for cloud storage
import { BUCKET_URL } from "../../../server/s3";

export const getImageUrl = (page: string, filename: string) => {
  return `${BUCKET_URL}/images/${page}/${filename}`;
};
